        \nThanks for checking out my app!\n
        \nAre you half way through a movie and sick of missing the best parts because your friends aren\'t made out of glass?
        Have you thrown something across the room to avoid getting up and walking over there?
        Did you over throw and put that full can of beer through a window? Or was your friend distracted when they caught it with their face?
        Avoid these issues, and more. Use technology to solve your problems instead.\n
        \nTo get started, place your ice cold beer in one of the loading bays. Make sure it\'s not open!
        Next, select the side of the couch that the beer is loaded on. The icon should be green on the same side of the couch as the beer.
        Now you can safely send it to your buddy, whether they are ready or not.\n
        \nEnjoy!\n
        \n- Tim Bretz"
